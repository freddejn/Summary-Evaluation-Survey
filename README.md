The linguistic quality questions are targeted to assess how readable
and fluent the summaries are, they measure qualities of the
summary and DO NOT involve a comparison with a model summary.

In all of the categories below please rate the summary according to:

1. Very Poor
2. Poor 
3. Barely Acceptable 
4. Good 
5. Very Good 

## 1 Grammaticality
  
  The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting,
  capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g.,
  fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read.
  (Datelines are newspaper metadata usually appearing in the first line of an article 
  such as (CNN) - ..., or STOCKHOLM (AP) - ...
  These should not be included in the summary is they do not add any information of value.)

## 2 Non-redundancy

  There should be no unnecessary repetition in the summary.
  Unnecessary repetition might take the form of whole sentences that
  are repeated, or repeated facts, or the repeated use of a noun or
  noun phrase (e.g., "Bill Clinton") when a pronoun ("he") would
  suffice.

## 3 Referential clarity
  
  It should be easy to identify who or what the pronouns and noun
  phrases in the summary are referring to. If a person or other entity
  is mentioned, it should be clear what their role in the story is.
  So, a reference would be unclear if an entity is referenced but its
  identity or relation to the story remains unclear.

## 4 Focus
  
  The summary should have a focus; sentences should only contain
  information that is related to the rest of the summary.

## 5 Structure and Coherence

  The summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The
  summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should
  build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information
  about a topic.
